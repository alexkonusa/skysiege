##Installing the files
For the loading scene script, put it on the events system in the main menu scene. Code for the button needs to be

var LoadScene = gameObject.GetComponent<LoadingScene> ().StartCoroutine ("Load");

For the AI scripts, apply tags as required. Then drag the enemy script to the enemies, playerAI script to the players, and then AISpawn to the events
system (this will have the eventsSystem tag)
